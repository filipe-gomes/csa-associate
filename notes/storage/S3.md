# S3

[Back to Index](../../README.md)

## Exam Tips / Summary

- Read the [S3 FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/)
- Storage
    - S3 storage is object-based. Files only.
    - Files can be 0 bytes to 5 TB.
    - Storage is unlimited.
- S3 is a universal namespace - you must have globally unique bucket names.
- Buckets are assigned a URL: https://s3.your-region-1.amazonaws.com/my-bucket-name
- Successful uploads generate a HTTP 200 status code.
- You can turn on MFA delete.
- Data consistency:
    - New PUT - read after write.
    - Update PUT or DELETE - eventual consistency.
- Tiered Storage Options
    - Standard
    - Infrequently Accessed (IA)
    - One Zone IA
    - Intelligent Tiering
    - Glacier
    - Glacier Deep Archive
- Versioning
    - Great backup tool
    - Can't be disabled, only suspended
    - Stores all versions - writes and deleted objects
    - Integrates with lifecycle rules
    - MFA delete

## Basics

S3 is a service that provides object/file storage. Objects are stored with:

- Key (name of the object)
- Value (sequence of bytes - the file itself)
- Version ID (important for versioning)
- Metadata (data about the data)
- Subresources (ACLs and Torrents)

## Data Consistency

**New object PUT**: Read after write (immediate)

**Overwrite PUTs and DELETEs**: Eventual consistency (may take time to propagate)

## Guarantees

99.9% availability for the platform (built for 99.99%)

99.999999999% durability for information in S3 (11x9s)

## Billing

Billing is based on the following usages:

- Storage
- Requests
- Storage management pricing (tiers)
- Data transfer
- Transfer acceleration/cross-region replication

## Features

### Tiered Storage

#### Standard
- 99.99% availability
- 99.999999999% durability
- Data is stored redundantly in multiple facilities/devices, and intended to sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently.

#### S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed)
- Lower fee than standard, but you are charged a retrieval fee

#### S3 One Zone - IA (RRS is deprecated, but approximately the same thing)
- When you want a lower cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require multi-AZ redundancy/resilience

#### S3 - Intelligent Tiering
- Uses machine learning to move data between storage tiers to optimize for cost
- No performance impact or overhead

#### S3 - Glacier
- Used for data archiving.
- You can restore any amount of data in a configurable amount of time (minutes to hours)

#### S3 - Glacier Deep Archive
- Lowest cost storage that AWS offers
- 12 hour retrieval time

### S3 Transfer Acceleration

Enables optimal file transfer between users and your bucket. Data is uploaded to Edge locations, and routed over an optimized network path to your S3 location.

Provides a distinct URL to upload to: https://myaccount.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com

### Lifecycle Management

You can automatically transition objects (including current and previous versions) to different storage tiers at a given time. You can also automatically expire items after a given time has passed.

### Versioning

This allows you to store all versions of an object, including writes and deletion.

- Great backup tool
- Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled - only suspended
- Integrates with lifecycle rules
- You can also use MFA delete on versioned objects

### Encryption

**In Transit**: Achieved by SSL/TLS

**At Rest (Server-Side Encryption - SSE)**:
- S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
- AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
- Customer-provided keys (SSE-C)

**At Rest (Client-Side Encryption)**: File is encrypted before upload

### Cross-Region Replication

- Select a target bucket
- Versioning must be enabled on source and dest. bucket
- Regions have to be unique
- Does not replicate existing files
- All subsequently updated files will be replicated
- Delete markers or version deletes are not replicated

### MFA Delete

Requires a user to confirm deletion via a second device, providing an extra layer of security.

### Security

- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
    - These can be defined at the object level
- Bucket policies
- Access logs, which can be turned on and sent to another bucket (even in another account)
